#####The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

####leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.

####Body = related to body movement.

####Gravity = acceleration of gravity

####Acc = accelerometer measurement

####Gyro = gyroscopic measurements

####Jerk = sudden movement acceleration

####Mag = magnitude of movement

####mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements. The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.
